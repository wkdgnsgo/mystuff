The vehicle was parked, as the officers exited their vehicle and approached. One officer approached the driver’s side, while a second officer approached the passenger side of the vehicle. The male placed his vehicle in reverse and began to back-up. As the vehicle moved in reverse, the sweater of the officer on the driver side of the vehicle became entangled with the moving vehicle and the vehicle began to drag the officer. The offender then placed his vehicle in drive and began to drive forward, still dragging the officer. Upon seeing his partner being dragged, the officer on the passenger side of the vehicle drew his weapon and discharged the weapon, striking the rear window of the vehicle. The officer being dragged broke free and the offender fled in his vehicle east on Cottman Avenue. A third uniformed officer in a marked police vehicle observed the vehicle traveling at a high rate of speed on Cottman Avenue and initiated a pursuit. The offender’s vehicle became involved in an auto accident at Frankford Avenue and Convent Lane, where he was ultimately apprehended after a brief foot pursuit. One officer involved in the apprehension of the offender deployed an Electronic Control Weapon to affect the offender’s arrest.

1262509,NA,1,F,N,B,M,U,NA,NA,2,B;W,M;M,Milwaukee Police Department,"This report is submitted by Lt. Jeff Point of the GIB Metro- Homicide Unit, early shift.On Monday 12-20-10 at approx. 12:21AM, District Seven Police Officers [redacted] and [redacted] while responding to a ca!I for service, discharged their service weapons at a suspect, Dionne A Brown, causing his death. This incident was thoroughly investigated by both the Criminal Investigation Bureau and the District Attorney's office, and what follows is a summary of the investigation and it's findings. It is not exhaustive of all details, and for a complete understanding of all aspects of the investigation, please refer to Milwaukee Police incident reports filed under IR103540005.Both officers were interviewed ClB detectives, as well as District Attorney John Chisolm and personnel from his staff. Both officers gave statements that were consistent with one another, witness accounts and the physical evidence, and their statements are summarized as follows:PO [redacted] stated that on Sunday 12-19-10, he was working on Squad [redacted] with his partner, PO [redacted]. Their hours that day were 7:00PM to 3:00AM. It should be noted that they had worked an overtime assignment from 3:00PM to 7:00PM, prior to their shift. They were both in full uniform at the time of this assignment.At approx. 11:46PM, they noted that among the backlog of assignments was an entry complaint at [redacted] and they volunteered for this assignment. Upon their arrival, they met with the complainant, [redacted] who related to them that her ex-boyfriend, Dionne Brown, had stolen items from her house, and that she could hear movement up in her attic and believed that Brown was hiding in the attic. She further informed the officers that Brown had a warrant for his arrest, and that is why he was hiding. She then directed the officers to the 2nd floor of the apartment, where the attic could be accessed via a scuttle hole in the ceiling. The officers opened the scuttle hole, and called into the attic and called out to Brown by name and told him to come down, but they got no response. PO [redacted] then used a chair and pulled himself up into the attic. The attic was not lighted, so used his flashlight to look around. He also drew his service weapon. The floor of the attic was covered with approx. 18 inches of blown insulation. PO [redacted] observed what he believed to be a person laying on the ground ln the west portion of the attic, trying to conceal himself under the insulation. He could see the insulation rising and falling with the suspect' s breathing. At about this same time, he saw an 11 inch kitchen knife laying on the floor near the attic opening, and he picked this knife up and moved it further away, to keep it out of reach of the suspect.After moving the knife, PO [redacted] holstered his weapon and drew his expandable baton. He used the baton to probe where the suspect (later ID' d as Brown) was hiding by tapping him. Brown then began to sit up, exposing his face, and PO [redacted] took several steps back to increase the distance between them. Brown stated to PO [redacted], ""Man, you broke my nose."" PO [redacted] began to order Brown to come out and show himself, but Brown did not.At some point, PO [redacted] became aware that another officer (PO [redacted]) had entered the attic, and was standing to his left and behind him. Brown then sat up and rotated his body so he was facing PO [redacted]. Brown reached into his front waistband with his right hand, and made a deliberate motion as though he was removingsomething from his waistband. Due to the insulation, PO [redacted] could not see what he was reaching for, but based on the movement, he believed Brown was reaching for a weapon. Both officers then yelled for Brown to show his hands several times.After about 25 seconds of this, Brown suddenly lunged at PO [redacted]. He both lunged with his body, and extended his right arm towards PO [redacted], causing [redacted] to fear that he had a weapon. Fearing for his safety and his partner's, he immediatelv began firing his weapon at Brown. He fired his handgun until the slide locked back. He was also aware that PO [redacted] was also firing his own weapon. PO [redacted] took a step to his left to avoid the lunge of Brown. Brown fell past him and fell down in a facedown position. Both officers approached Brown and handcuffed him behind his back. They then called down to the other officers and requested medical attention, and that the suspect was PNB.At about this time, PO [redacted] felt coldness around his left buttock.He checked his body and found a hole in his pants in that area, and he realized that he had been shot. The bullet wound was a graze wound, and was minor enough that PO [redacted] was able to lower himself out of the attic. He was subsequently taken to St. Joseph's Hospital, where he was treated and released for his minor injury.Prior to being conveyed to the hospital, PO [redacted] duty belt and handgun was taken from him and secured. It was subsequently examined by detectives, and was found to be unloaded with an empty magazine inserted. This is consistent with his account of firing to lock back, but having not reloaded. His handgun and magazines were invventoried and a replacement handgun issued to him.PO [redacted] was also interviewed about his actions in this incident, and he gave the following account. PO [redacted] was working on Sunday 12-19-10, and was working on Squad [redacted] with his partner, PO [redacted]. Their hours of work were 7:00PM to 3:00AM. Both officers were in full MPD uniform at the time of their shift. At approx. 12:15AM, they were on patrol, and they heard PO [redacted] of Squad [redacted] requesting another squad and a sergeant at their assignment, and they volunteered. En route, they read the CAD call for this assignment and learned that they were going to an entry complaint and that the caller was irate.When they got to the apartment, they went inside. He observed PO [redacted] standing near the top of the stairs, and he was told that PO [redacted] was up in the attic with a possible suspect, and volunteered to go up into the attic to help PO [redacted]. He climbed up through the scuttle hole into the attic. Once he got into the attic, he could see that [redacted] was in the attic, and was pointing his flashlight at a suspect who was under the insulation. [redacted] could only see the suspect' s face, and [redacted] could see that he was a black male. It was very dark, and he also used his flashlight to light up the suspect. He and [redacted] both yelled for the suspect to show his hands. They were about six to eight feet away from him at this time, and they moved closer to him, to take him into custody. The attic space they were in was very small and cramped, limiting their ability to move around.PO [redacted] saw the suspect (Dionne Brown) sit up, and begin looking around him as though looking for something. He then reached with his right hand towards his waistband, as though he was reaching for a weapon. PO [redacted] feared that Brown was reaching for a weapon, and he and PO [redacted] were in close proximity to Brown. Brown then lunged towards [redacted] and thrust his right arm forward, in a motion as though to stab him. He then drew his service we·aoon and began firing at Brown in an effort to stop his aggressive actions. [redacted] was also firing at the suspect, and while doing so, he stepped in front of [redacted] so [redacted] stopped firing. [redacted] then stepped out of this line of fire, and [redacted] could see that Brown was still swinging his arm at PO [redacted] as though trying to cut him with a knife, so he continued to fire at Brown. He fired until his weapon locked back on the empty magainze, and then reloaded it.At this time, he could see that Brown had stopped moving and was laying face down, and did not apoear to be a threat any longer. He then re-holstered his weapon, and both officers handcuffed the suspect. They then yelled down to the other officers that they were OK. PO [redacted] then informed [redacted] that he thought he had been shot in the buttocks, and [redacted] observed a tear and blood on his pants near his left buttocks. At this time he realized that he had probably accidentally shot PO during this incident, and told this to [redacted].Very shortly after this happened, PO [redacted] heard the voice of Sgt. [redacted] coming from downstairs. Sgt. [redacted] egan directing the actions of the officers and asking them questions about the suspect's condition and what happened. Sgt. [redacted] instructed [redacted] to come down from the attic, and he did so. He was taken by Sgt. [redacted] to Sgt. [redacted]'s squad, where he remained until ClB arrived.PO [redacted] issued Smith & Wesson handgun was examined by detectives at the scene. His handgun was loaded with a magazine and 13 rounds, plus one round in the chamber. One of the magazines in his pouch was empty (which he recovered after the shooting.) This is consistent with his account that he fired his gun until the slide locked back. His handgun and magazines were inventoried, and a replacement handgun issued to him.Subsequent to their statements on the night of the incident, all standard protocols for an officer-involved shooting were complied with, including inventorying the officers' weapons, issuing new weapons to them, placing them on administrative duty, and conveying them for drug testing.PO [redacted] partner on this day was PO [redacted]. PO [redacted] was also interviewed, and gave the following account. He and PO [redacted] were working togetner on this night, and they responded to the call for another squad at [redacted]. When they got to the apartment and went in, there were two citizens in the lower unit, and PO [redacted] was standing at the top of the stairs. PO [redacted] told them that his partner, PO [redacted] was up in the attic with the suspect, and he asked one of them to go up and help him, and PO  [redacted] volunteered. PO [redacted] could hear [redacted] saying, ""keep showing me your hands, I know you have a knife"" but could not see him in the attic. He then heard both officers ordering the suspect to show his hands, followed by 5-8 gunshots. He was not in a position to observe the actions of the officers or the suspect. He called up to the officers, who told him that they were OK. He then got on the radio and requested additional squads, a sergeant and a med unit.PO [redacted] handgun was examined, and did not appear to have been fired.PO [redacted] partner, PO [redacted] was interviewed by detectives and gave the following account. He and [redacted] had been dispatched to the entry complaint at 4321 W. Olive at about 11:46PM. When they got to the scene, the female caller [redacted] let them in the apartment and explained that her ex-boyfriend had broken in and was in the attic. The officers went upstairs and tried to make verbal contact with Brown. When they could not get him to respond, PO [redacted] volunteered to go up into the attic, and PO [redacted] helped him lift himself into the attic.PO [redacted] could hear his partner say to Brown that he could see him under the insulation. Wilson also said that he had found a knife in the attic. PO [redacted] radioed for an additional squad, and POs [redacted] and [redacted] arrived a few minutes later. PO [redacted] also went up into the attic with PO [redacted]. About 10-20 seconds later, he heard PO [redacted] yell to the suspect to show his hands. PO [redacted] repeated this command several times, and after that, PO [redacted] heard the sound of shots coming from the attic. He heard 5-10 shots, but could not see what was happening in the attic. Both officers in the attic yelled down that they were OK. PO [redacted] radioed for medical attention and additional squads, and PO [redacted] went downstairs to check on the occupants of the house.

She resides at the apartment where this incident occurred, and the suspect Brown is her ex-boyfriend. She related that on this date at about 8:00PM, she received a call from Brown, and he indicated that he had broken into her apartment and was going to steal her TV and her childrens' Christmas presents if she did not come back home. She, along with several members of her family, then went back to her apartment. When they entered, they found items missing, leading her to believe that Brown had in fact been inside her apartment. She then called the police to report the burglary. When the officers arrived, as she was letting them in the door, she saw the wooden board which covers the scuttle ho!e being moved, and at that time realized that Brown was probably hiding in the attic, and she informed the police of this. The officers went upstairs, and she could hear them calling out to Brown by his name and trying to talk him out of the attic. She left the apartment and went and sat in her vehicle and made a phone call. As she was doing this, she heard 6-8 gunshots coming from inside her apartment. Shortly after that more police officers arrived on the scene, and she was escorted back into her apartment.Another citizen witness was interviewed- [redacted] B/M [redacted] who resides at [redacted] is the brother of [redacted]. Mr. [redacted] was interviewed by detectives, and gave an account very similar to his sister's. He stated that once they all arrived back at her house and found that it had been entered, she called the police, and they waited for the police to arrive.

Another squad arrived, and two more officers came inside the house. [redacted] was seated on the couch in the living room on the first floor. He heard the officers calling out to Brown by name, trying to talk him out of the attic. After a while of this, he heard the officers ordering Brown to show his hands, the he heard 5-6 shots coming from upstairs. At this time, Jones got up from the couch and ran to the back of the apartment, towards the rear exit, and at this time he heard additional shots coming from upstairs. He then went outside to where his sister [redacted] was seated in her car. They remained there until more officers arrived, at which time they were escorted back into the apartment, and eventually separated and placed into squad cars until they could be interviewed by detectives.It should be noted that there two additional citizen witnesses who were present inside the apartment and were a!so witnesses to this incident. Their accounts are substantially similar to those of [redacted] and [redacted]. Both were interviewed by detectives and their statements are contained on supplemental reports.This incident took place in the attic above the apartment located at [redacted] in the [redacted]. The attic is unfinished, and the floor of it was covered with approx. 18 inches of blown insulation. lt should be noted that Brown was pronounced dead while still in the attic, and his body was removed from the attic area, through the scuttle hole, by MFD personnel.

The scene was extensively photographed, measured and documented by the investigating detectives.On Monday 12-20-10, an autopsy was conducted by the Milwaukee County Medical Examiners office.

Officers Nicholas Lietz and Ronald Godfrey were assigned as a plain-clothes unit, driving an unmarked pick-up truck, when they attempted to stop Joseph Buckman, who was suspected of being involved in a hand to hand narcotics transacton. As Mr. Buckman left in a vehicle from the Speedway, 11301 Westport Road, he fled on I-265 east bound. The officers attempted to locate the subject on I-265 after he fled, driving erratically. They located the subject's vehicle (which was stolen) on the exit ramp from I-265 to Brownsboro Rd. Ofc. Lietz pursued the subject on foot into a wooded area. Mr. Buckman refused officer's commands to stop. Mr. Buckman was attempting to scale a wooden fence, when he turned abruptly with something in his hands. Ofc. Lietz stated Mr. Buckman made a movement with his hands, which he perceived to be the manipulation of a possible weapon and thus a deadly threat. Ofc. Lietz fired at the subject several times striking him 1 time in the leg. Evidence at the scene determined the item in Mr. Buckman's hands to be a cigarette package containing possible narcotics, which he may have been attempting to dispose of. The investigation was presented to the Commonwealth's Attorney's Office. In a letter dated 3/18/2016, Assistant Commonwealth's Attorney Mark Miller opined at the time Ofc. Lietz made contact with Mr. Buckman, he had sufficient information for him to be concerned for his safety and that of other responding officers. Clearly, under the low-light situation that existed at the time, with the distance between the two, with Mr. Buckman's back to the officer, and knowing how desperate his actions were to evade the police, it was reasonable for Ofc. Lietz to interpret these actions as a threat to himself, and potentially Ofc. Godfrey, and it was reasonable to take actions necessary to defend himself. On 4/11/2016, Mr. Buckman pled guilty to Receiving Stolen Property under $10,000, Fleeing & Evading Police 1st and 2nd Degree, Possession of a Controlled Substance (Methamphetamine) 1st Degree and Possession of Drug Paraphernalia.",Louisville,NA

Jeff Point of the GIB- Metro Homicide Division, nights.On Tuesday 9-14-10 at approx. 9:04PM, PO [redacted], assigned to District Three- Late Power shift, while acting as back-up on a Battery- Domestic Violence assignment, discharged his service weapon at a suspect, Kenneth W. Whitaker after Whitaker pointed a shotgun in his direction, causing a non-life threatening injury to [redacted]. This incident was thoroughly investigated by both the Criminal Investigation Bureau and the District Attorney's office, and What follows is a summary of the investigation and it's findings. It is not exhaustive of all details, and for a complete understanding of al! aspects of the investigation, please refer to Milwaukee Police incident reports filed under lR 102570167.PO [redacted] was interviewed on the night of the incident by CIB detectives, as well as District Attorney John Chisolm and personnel from his staff. His statement was consistent with that of other officers, witness accounts and the physical evidence, and his statement is summarized as follows:On Tuesday 9-14~10, PO [redaced] was working on Squad [redacted with his partner, PO [redacted], working late power hours, 7PM-3AM. Both officers were in uniform and driving a marked MPD squad. He recalled that they were on patrol, when they heard and responded to a call from another squad requesting backup at a Battery DV assignment at 25th/Wells. The suspect was supposed to be inside of a house there, armed with a shotgun. Sq. 3430 and several other squads responded to the backup, where they learned that the suspect was located inside of 755 N. 25th St. The officers formulated a strategy to arrest the suspect, and PO [redacted] and his partner were assigned to rear containment on the house. The officers approached the house, and POs [redacted], along with PO [redacted] proceeded to the rear of the house for containment, while other officers approached the front of the house.The three officers went to the rear, and PO [redacted] drew his service weapon due to the possibility of the suspect being armed. At the rear of the house, he could see an illuminated 2nd story window with a box fan in the window. At the same time he could hear the other officers at the front of the house attempting to make contact with the suspect. After about 10 seconds, he saw the box fan being removed from the window, and a black male suspect, slender and in his 20s, wearing a white T-shirt appeared in the window. The suspect was holding a shotgun with both hands, standing in a bladed stance and pointing the shotgun in the direction of PO [redacted]. PO [redacted] ordered the suspect to ""drop the gun"" and believes that his partner also made this command. The suspect did not drop the gun, and PO [redacted], fearing that the suspect was going to shoot at them, fired one shot from his handgun at the suspect. He was about 8-10 feet away from the outside wall of the house at this time. After the shot the suspect retreated back into the house, and PO [redacted] heard another officer announcing the shots fired. PO [redacted] maintained his position on rear containment, and a short time later he heard the other officers announce that the suspect was in custody, and also request medical attention for his gunshot wound, and that was when he first knew for certain that he had struck the suspect. Shortly after that Sgt. [redacted] came to the rear of the house, relieved [redacted] from his post and took him to Sgt [redacted] car, where he remained until CIB detectives arrived. PO [redacted] was armed with his standard issue M&P 40 handgun. His weapon was examined and found to have an unfired round in the chamber and 13 rounds in the magazine, consistent with his account of firing one shot. Additionally one spent .40 cal shell casing was found at the rear of the house.Subsequent to his statement on the day of the incident, all standard protocols for an officer-involved shooting were complied with, including collecting PO [redacted] weapon, issuing a new weapon to him, placing him on administrative duty, and conveying him for drug testing.PO [redacted] was also interviewed on the night of this incident by CIB detectives and gave the following account: He was working with PO [redacted] on Sq. [redacted] when they responded to the request for backup at the Battery DV complaint, with a suspect armed wlth a shotgun. When they arrived at the house, himself, PO [redacted] and PO [redacted] went to the rear of the house for containment. He stood near the southwest corner of the residence, while PO [redacted] went to the northwest corner, while Jelinek stood between them. A short time later he heard movement inside the house, and he looked up and saw a black male sticking his head and shoulder sticking out of the window, holding a shotgun that he was pointing down at PO [redacted] and he yelled for the suspect to drop the gun. PO [redacted] heard a single gunshot, and saw the suspect retreat back inside the house, but he could not tell at that instant which of the other officers fired the shot. PO [redacted] had his own gun drawn but he did not fire. Shortly after that he heard the other officers say that the suspect was in custody.Numerous other officers who were present at this incident were also interviewed and gave accounts substantially similar to those of POs [redacted] and [redacted]. Additionally, several citizens witnesses were interviewed and provided partial accounts that were consistent with the officers' statements, however no citizen was found to be a direct eyewitness to the shooting incident. The suspect Kenneth Whitaker was interviewed by detectives about his involvement. He had been treated for a minor gunshot wound to his left shoulder and released from the hospital. He gave several untruthful versions of events, but eventually admitted that he was present inside the house, that his brother had removed the box fan from the window that that he (Whitaker) had held the shotgun out the window for the purpose of placing it onto a ledge to hide it. He did admit that while he was holding the gun out the window it was pointed down towards the ground, however he did not admit to pointing it intentionally at the officers.The scene investigation revealed a sawed-off Mossberg 500 shotgun inside the upper bedroom where the officers had observed the suspect pointing the gun out of the window. As a result of his statements admitting possession this gun, Whitaker was charged by the DA with Possession of Short Barrelled Shotgun and ESBUODW- Pointing Firearm at Law Enforcement Officer. The actions of PO [redacted] were reviewed by DA John Chisolm. Based upon his preliminary review, he felt that the actions of PO [redacted] were within the guidelines of the law and that no criminal charges would be forthcoming. On 10-16-11 DA Chisolm delivered a letter to the department declaring his findings that the actions of PO [redacted] on 9-14-10 constituted a privileged use of reasonable and justifiable force.",Milwaukee,1 shot fired; 1 hit (to the left shoulder); victim armed with shotgun

Different accounts have surfaced regarding what led to the knife chase. Abraham P. told investigators that Perez-Lopez wanted to buy his bike and chased him with a knife when he refused to sell it to him. Press accounts reported that Perez-Lopez chased Abraham P. with a knife because Abraham P. had taken his cell phone. (The cell phone was later located by police in Perez-Lopez’s pocket.) A roommate of Perez-Lopez told investigators that Abraham P. had been arguing with Perez-Lopez about whether Perez-Lopez lived at 2843 Folsom Street and had blocked Perez-Lopez from entering the house, when Perez-Lopez walked away but then returned, ran into the house to get a knife, and then ran out of the house and chased Abraham P. down Folsom Street, yelling “Aren’t you macho!” This last account is supported by a MUNI bus video which appears to show Perez-Lopez and Abraham P. standing and facing each other inside the gated area of 2843 Folsom Street, with Abraham P. possibly blocking the entrance to the home. As described in detail in the witness statements below, the knife chase was observed by a neighbor who was out for a jog and by a woman who was waiting for a bus. At 9:44 p.m., the neighbor called 911, described what he had seen, and said he was located at 24th and Folsom Streets, near the bus stop. He described both men as Latin males, five feet, five inches tall, in their thirties, and he gave the address of the house on Folsom Street he believed they may have come out of. The witness described the knife the man was carrying as approximately 12-inches long and shiny, and said both men were running very fast. Based on the 911 call, at 9:45 p.m. SFPD dispatch broadcasted a report of a person with a knife at 24th and Folsom Streets. A marked police unit and a backup unit immediately began a Code 3 response (lights and sirens activated) to the scene. Dispatch further advised officers that the reporting person said that a man was chasing another man with a knife, now running towards 25th Street; that both men were around 5 foot 5 inches tall wearing beanies; and that the men were yelling in Spanish and may have come out of a house on Folsom Street. Additional police units began responding to the scene in Code 3. STATEMENTS OF OFFICERS INVOLVED IN THE SHOOTING Officers Eric Reboli (Star # 1651) and Craig Tiffe (Star # 1312) were in plainclothes and travelling in an unmarked police car near 24th and Harrison Streets when they heard the first broadcast. Officer Reboli was driving and Officer Tiffe was in the front passenger seat. At 9:46 p.m. Officer Tiffe used the computer in their car to electronically place them on the call as a backup responder. Because they were so close to the location, they did not make a Code 3 response. According to Officer Reboli, as they reached the intersection of 25th and Folsom Streets, he saw movement mid-block on the east side of Folsom Street which looked like people running around in the street. He turned the car and proceeded northbound on Folsom Street. Approximately mid-block he saw a male (Abraham P.) standing in the lane of traffic while 2 leaning against a parked car (a blue Nissan), and a second male (Perez-Lopez) standing on the sidewalk, on the opposite side of the parked car. He alerted Officer Tiffe to the presence of the two men, and then parked one to two car lengths behind the blue Nissan. He got out of the driver’s side of the unmarked police car and went to make contact with Abraham P., who was still standing in the lane of traffic. Officer Reboli was wearing his police star clipped to his belt directly in front of his holstered firearm. He announced himself as a police officer and then immediately grabbed Abraham P. by both arms and pinned his arms together in case he was the man with the knife, referenced in the broadcast. Officer Reboli observed that Abraham P. was breathing hard, seemed “almost exhausted,” and was saying something he did not understand. Officer Reboli told Abraham P. they were going to get out of the street and figure out what was going on, and then walked him towards the sidewalk, between the blue Nissan and a silver Toyota parked in front of it. As he was walking Abraham P. in between the two parked cars towards the sidewalk to get him out of the lane of traffic, he glanced over the car at the sidewalk and saw Officer Tiffe speaking to Perez-Lopez, who had his back to Officer Reboli. A few seconds later, Officer Reboli glanced over again and saw Officer Tiffe trying to take Perez-Lopez down to the ground and Perez-Lopez “violently resisting.” Officer Reboli immediately let go of Abraham P. and ran to assist his partner. Once he was five or six feet away from Officer Tiffe and Perez-Lopez, he saw Officer Tiffe lunge backwards and put his hands up with his palms facing outward, “saw a flash of a very large silver knife,” and thought Officer Tiffe may have been stabbed. After he saw Officer Tiffe lunge backwards and saw the flash of the knife, Officer Reboli saw Perez-Lopez turn, face him and start to run in his direction. Officer Reboli stopped, took one or two large steps backwards and reached for his pepper spray and firearm at the same time. He drew his firearm but was unable to get the pepper spray out of his pocket.1 He then shouted either “Police, drop the knife” or “Drop the knife,” at which point Perez-Lopez momentarily stopped, looked at him and then back at Officer Tiffe, and then continued to advance towards Officer Reboli while holding the knife and making slashing motions. Officer Reboli could not recall in which hand Perez-Lopez held the knife, but thought the knife was held with the blade facing out and upward. Officer Reboli said Perez-Lopez was still on the sidewalk, but near the curb, approximately five to six feet away from him. As Perez-Lopez came towards him, he feared he was about to be stabbed. He also feared for the life of his partner, who he thought may have been stabbed, and for the life of Abraham P., who he believed was still in very close proximity. Officer Reboli said he discharged his firearm at Perez-Lopez to stop the threat to his life and to the lives of his partner and Abraham P. Officer Reboli explained that, once he started to discharge his firearm, Perez-Lopez began turning toward the street, then took a step or two before collapsing, face-down between the two parked cars. Officer Reboli saw the knife fall from Perez-Lopez’ grip and watched as it came to rest in the street, above Perez-Lopez’ left shoulder but within his reach. 1 Photos taken of Officer Reboli right after the shooting show what appears to be the top of a pepper spray canister in his right rear pocket, the same side on which his firearm was carried. 3 According to Officer Tiffe, as he and Officer Reboli drove down Folsom Street in response to the 911 dispatch, he initially only saw Abraham P. standing near the driver’s side door the blue Nissan, close to the side-view mirror. As he exited the passenger side of the police car, he saw Perez-Lopez near the side-view mirror on the passenger side of the blue Nissan. At that point, both males were facing each other from opposite sides of the car. Officer Tiffe had his police star displayed on his chest, hanging from a silver chain on the outside of his jacket. He approached Perez-Lopez on the sidewalk from the rear passenger side of the blue Nissan, as Perez-Lopez stood leaning on the car with his body facing towards the street, leaving only his left side visible to Officer Tiffe. As Officer Tiffe reached the rear bumper of the blue Nissan, Perez-Lopez looked over his left shoulder and made eye contact with him. Officer Tiffe said he thought Perez-Lopez appeared to be in some type of altered state and described the look on his face as “bloodlust crazed.” He announced himself as a police officer as he walked towards Perez-Lopez and asked him to step away from the car. He continued walking towards Perez-Lopez, who did not move away from the car as commanded and did not acknowledge him. Officer Tiffe then pointed to the star on his chest, in case Perez-Lopez did not speak English, but he could not tell if Perez-Lopez looked at it or understood he was a police officer since he said nothing and simply appeared to “look through” him. Officer Tiffe believed that Perez-Lopez was either “on something” or too engaged in what he was doing to respond to verbal commands, so he decided to make physical contact with him. As Officer Tiffe got close to Perez-Lopez, he saw Perez-Lopez’s left hand go up, so he grabbed Perez-Lopez’s left arm and his right, back shoulder area, and pulled him away from the car. He then saw Perez-Lopez holding something in his right hand, which was down by his side. Officer Tiffe ordered Perez-Lopez to “Get on the ground!” and spun him around to try to forcibly take him down to the ground. As Officer Tiffe did this, Perez-Lopez suddenly lunged up at him with his right hand. Officer Tiffe disengaged from Perez-Lopez by pushing him about three feet away, and then he saw Perez-Lopez swipe at his chest with the object in his right hand. Once the swipe was completed, Officer Tiffe could see that the object in Perez-Lopez’ right hand was “a very large knife,” which Perez-Lopez was now waving around in the air with the blade pointing up. Officer Tiffe said he knew by this point that Officer Reboli had come to his aid and was on the sidewalk to his right, behind Perez-Lopez. As soon as he saw the knife in Perez-Lopez’s hand, Officer Tiffe drew his firearm and yelled either “Put down the knife” or “Put down the knife or I’ll shoot.” Officer Tiffe said he believed at that moment that Perez-Lopez was going to kill him if given the opportunity, and kill anybody in his way. As Officer Tiffe was shouting commands for Perez-Lopez to drop the knife and focusing on the knife “flailing in the air,” he heard Officer Reboli also yelling something, saw Perez-Lopez take a step in Officer Reboli’s direction with the knife raised, and heard shots. Officer Tiffe recalled that, as the shots were being fired, Perez-Lopez was “kind of moving in different directions,” was at some point “facing, at some point he was turning away,” and appeared to fixate on 4 something in the street, south of where he was standing. He then saw Perez-Lopez take a step between the two parked cars, and raise the knife, either in an outstretched or overhead manner. He didn’t know exactly where Abraham P. was at that point but believed he was very close and thought that Perez-Lopez was going after him, so he fired his weapon one time and saw Perez-Lopez fall to the ground. Officer Tiffe recalled that he next saw Abraham P. “cowering down” on the driver’s side of the blue Nissan, near the driver’s side rear tire, being talked to by Officer Cabillo, who had arrived at the scene moments after the shooting.",San Francisco,knife

When the officers got out of their squad car to investigate, they noticed that Kern had a pistol at his waist, authorities said. It was unclear if the gun was in a holster. The officers told Kern to show his hands, but police say he went for the pistol instead and turned toward the officers with it.

Upon arrival, entry into the location was made by the Regional Fugitive Task Force. The team was overcome by smoke that was emanating from a container on the floor inside the apartment. Detectives called out to an individual observed inside to exit location but received no response, leading them to tactically withdraw from inside the location due to the smoke condition. The team placed a call for additional units and FDNY to respond. FDNY responded to the scene and was informed by members of the Regional Fugitive Task Force that a wanted fugitive was believed to be inside the location. A Lieutenant from the FDNY entered the location in an attempt to assist the individual inside.

Three, while conducting a field interview of three suspects inside an auto, discharged their service weapons at the suspects after one ot them fired a shotgun at PO [redacted]. One of the suspects, Darion May, received a non-life threatening gunshot wound to his left wrist. This incident was thoroughly investigated by both the Criminal Investigation Bureau and the District Attorney's office, and what follows is a summary of the investigation and it's findings. It is not exhaustive of all details, and for a complete understanding of all aspects of the investigation, please refer to Milwaukee Police incident reports filed under IR 102350207.PO [redacted] and PO [redacted] were interviewed on the day of the incident by CIB detectives, as well as Deputy District Attorney Kent Lovern and personnel from his staff. Their statements were consistent with that of other officers, witness accounts and the physical evidence, and their statements are summarized as follows:On 8-23-10 at about 9:00PM, Squad [redacted] staffed by POs [redacted] and [redacted] was on duty, with both officers in full MPD uniform. They were assigned to a foot beat, and were walking near N. 39th and W. Wright. While patrolling their beat, they decided to walk into the alley between N 38 and N 39 in the 2500 block to check out agarage that had been burglarized in the past. When they got to this alley, the officers observed a maroon Volvo parked in the alley, with the engine running and it's lights off. The officers found this to be suspicious, and decided to approach the car and investigate.The officers walked up to the car, with PO [redacted] standing at the driver's side and PO [redacted] standing near the front of the car. PO [redacted] shined his flashlight into the car, lighting up the inside, and they both saw several occupants inside. A voice from inside the car said, ""oh shit"" and immediately, the rear seat occupant reached out of the right side rear window, holding a sawed-off shotgun. The suspect pointed the shotgun in the direction of PO [redacted] and fired one shot. At the same time, the car began moving forward.PO [redacted], having just been shot at, feared for his safety and that of his partner, and drew his duty pistol and began firing at the rear passenger area of the car where the suspect was seated. PO [redacted], having witnessed his partner being shot at, also drew his weapon and fired at the suspect in the car as it drove past. PO [redacted] fired 12 rounds, and PO [redacted] fired eight rounds. They immediately called out this incident over their portable radios.The suspect car traveled north in the alley, and at one point PO [redacted] reported hearing another shot from the suspect auto.

Wright St., which is along the suspect auto's route of flight. There was a single fired shell in the chamber. A cursory examination of the interior of the auto revealed a plastic bag containing a quantity of .410 shotgun shells.At the original scene, detective discovered and recovered twelve .40cal casings near the area where PO [redacted] was standing, and seven .40cal casings near where PO [redacted] was standing when he fired.Both officers' weapons and magazines were inspected by detectives as part of the interview process. PO [redacted] weapon was found to have fired eight rounds, and PO [redacted] weapon fired 12 rounds, based upon the number of remaining rounds in their magazines.Subsequent to their statements on the night of the incident, all standard protocols for an officer-involved shooting were complied with, including collecting both officers' weapons, issuing new weapons to them, placing them on administrative duty, and conveying them for drug testing.An extensive canvas in the area did not reveal any citizens who were direct eye witnesses to this incident.The suspect Garcia was questioned by detectives and gave this statement: Earlier in the evening, he had driven his Volvo (registered to his sister) to pick up his friend May at 32nd and Lloyd. They spent the next few hours together, eating some food at Garcia's house, and driving around and smoking some marijuana. They stopped at a gas station to buy some ""blunts"" for smoking marijuana. At some point, Garcia allowed May to drive the car, as Garcia was too high and was on prescription medications. At one point they went to May's house, where May retrieved the shotgun, and they got back into the car. They then drove to Logan's house and picked him up, and the three of them continued to drive around. Logan wanted to fire the shotgun, so they drove into an alley. May loaded the gun and handed it to Logan, who held it out the window. Garcia saw a flashlight shining at them, which he described as a ""cop's flashlight."" Logan then fired one shot from the shotgun, and May drove off, and he heard numerous shots being fired at them. During this he heard Logan something to the effect of, ""it's the police, !et me out."" They then drove a short distance until May crashed the car, when they all got out and ran, and he was eventually taken into custody.Colby Logan was interviewed by CIB detectives, and eventually gave the following account: He was picked up in the evening by May and Garcia who are friends of his and they drove around. May was driving, Garcia was in the front passenger seat and Logan at in the back seat. They drove around and smoked some marijuana while they did so. At some point May drive to a house, left the car and went inside and came back out about a minute later. When he returned, May had a shotgun, and May got back in the car with the gun and drove away.
